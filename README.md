# Project 2: Cohort Analysis and Revenue Metrics for SaaS Company  ( https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/merve.al.kan/viz/GoIT-Homework2-Merve/ODEV4-Dashboard2?publish=yes )
This project showcases a comprehensive revenue measurement dashboard developed on Tableau Public. It provides a clear and actionable overview of critical financial metrics, empowering stakeholders with data-driven insights.

## Enhanced Functionality:

This iteration expands upon the previous version by introducing several new features:

* Calculated Metrics: Worksheets were created to calculate metrics like New Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) and total revenue growth over time, providing more granular insights into revenue trends.
* Cohort Analysis: A cohort analysis was conducted to examine the revenue generated by customers who subscribed in different months. This deepens understanding of customer lifecycle and subscription patterns.
* Enhanced Data Exploration:
A graph illustrating total revenue and its percentage change over time was incorporated for a clear visual representation of revenue growth.
Location and time filters were added to enable dynamic exploration of revenue data by different customer segments and time periods.
* Heatmap Visualization: A color-coded heatmap depicts the revenue contribution of each customer cohort over time, visually highlighting high-performing cohorts.
* Cohesive Dashboard Design: All worksheets have been integrated into a single, user-friendly dashboard for a comprehensive view of the company's financial performance.


# Project 3:  Analyzing User Journeys in E-Commerce (BigQuery & Google Analytics 4)  ( https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?sq=585628036168:d6e02c9772a5487dbbdf898b8a14c381 ) & ( https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?sq=585628036168:27d0616e68a3497eae44533f3091cc77 )

This project explores user behavior within a sample e-commerce dataset for January 2021, leveraging Google Analytics 4 and BigQuery.

# Project 5: Handwriting Recognition via Machine Learning ( https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tbmznzXYPx4pdAKBWfzi_o7TKE8yuozq/view )

This project delves into the development of robust algorithms for recognizing handwritten characters using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The primary objective was to create a model capable of accurately classifying handwritten digits and names.

## Key Achievements:

* High Accuracy on MNIST: The model achieved an impressive accuracy of 99.30% on the widely recognized MNIST dataset, demonstrating its proficiency in classifying handwritten digits.
* Real-world Application: The model was further tested on a dataset containing handwritten names and surnames, achieving an accuracy of 72.63%. This showcases the model's ability to generalize to more complex and real-world scenarios.

## Methodology:

* Convolutional Neural Networks: CNNs were employed as the core architecture for feature extraction and classification due to their exceptional performance in image recognition tasks.
* Data Preprocessing: The datasets were preprocessed to ensure consistency and enhance model performance, including normalization and augmentation techniques.
* Model Training: The model was trained on the preprocessed data using an optimized training procedure, including hyperparameter tuning and regularization techniques.
* Evaluation: The model's performance was evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Technologies Used:

* Python: The primary programming language for implementing the model.
* TensorFlow/Keras: Deep learning frameworks used for building and training the CNN.
* MNIST Dataset: A benchmark dataset for handwritten digit recognition.
* Custom Dataset: A dataset containing handwritten names and surnames for real-world evaluation.
